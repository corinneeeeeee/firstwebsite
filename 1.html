<img src="jellyfish.jpg" width="100%"<br>
<P><Strong>Jellyfish</Strong> are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped <u><a href="https://www.amnh.org/explore/news-blogs/news-posts/anatomy-of-a-jellyfish">bells</a></u> and trailing <U><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tentacle">tentacles</a></U>, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile.</P>
<P>The <u>bell</u> can pulsate to provide propulsion for highly efficient locomotion.<br> The <u>tentacles</u> are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators.</P>
