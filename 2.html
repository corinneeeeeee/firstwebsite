<P><Strong>Sea slugs</Strong>,also called marine <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastropoda">gastropods</a></u>, over evolutionary time have either completely lost their shells, or have seemingly lost their shells due to having a greatly reduced or internal shell. Sea slugs have an enormous variation in body shape, color, and size.  </P>
<P> They have small, razor-sharp teeth, called <u><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/radula">radulas. </a></u>Most sea slugs have a pair of <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinophore">rhinophores</a></u>—sensory tentacles used primarily for the sense of smell—on their head, with a small eye at the base of each rhinophore. </P>
<p>Sea slugs have brains. For example, Aplysia californica has a brain of about 20,000 nerve cells!!!</p>
